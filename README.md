# Etch-a-Sketch

## About:
This is my first official project that I took to completion. It was guided by the Odin Project.

## Purpose:
The Etch-a-Sketch program is quite similar to a real life etch-a-sketch. You move your cursor over squares that you want to fill, and it gets filled with color. In my variant, I decided to add the option to have any of regular, grayscale, or rainbow color. You can also choose your desired number of rows/columns from 2 up 64.

## Conclusion:
In this project, I was able to utilize the very obscure '''cloneNode(true)''' method, alongisde using the sine function to model the distribution of colors with the rainbow mode. I used the modulo function for alternating grayscale shading.
